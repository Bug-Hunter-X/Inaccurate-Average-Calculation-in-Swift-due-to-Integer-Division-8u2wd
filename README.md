# Inaccurate Average Calculation in Swift
This example demonstrates a common error in Swift when calculating the average of an array of numbers. The issue arises from implicit integer division when using integers instead of Doubles, leading to inaccurate results.
The `calculateAverage` function initially uses integer division, but the updated version (`calculateAverageFixed`) uses `Double` to ensure accurate calculations.  The README file details the problem and the solution.
